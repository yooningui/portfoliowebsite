## Overview

Foody is an AI-driven mobile application designed to help users discover new dishes and restaurants tailored to their individual tastes. As the **Full Stack Engineer**, I led the design and development of intelligent, interactive interfaces that visualize personalized food recommendations while ensuring seamless integration between frontend and backend systems.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Built a novel recommendation system leveraging **semantic search**, **multi-vector retrieval**, and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to generate hyper-personalized food suggestions based on user behavior and context.
- **Cross-Platform App Development**: Developed the mobile app using **React Native**, **Expo**, and **TypeScript**, ensuring smooth performance and consistent design across devices.
- **Backend Integration**: Integrated a **FastAPI + PostgreSQL** backend with **LLM-driven recommendation logic**, enabling scalable and accurate personalization.
- **Frictionless Review System**: Designed a minimalist review feature focused on core interactions—allowing users to effortlessly share opinions while preserving key usability.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Published the app on the **App Store**, iterating rapidly based on user feedback to enhance usability, responsiveness, and design quality.
- **Collaborative Development**: Worked closely with designers and backend engineers to deliver cohesive, user-centered AI experiences from concept to deployment.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native (Expo)**: Cross-platform mobile app framework for building performant, native-quality interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and scalable code architecture.
- **FastAPI**: Backend framework powering the recommendation API and business logic.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing user data, preferences, and recommendation metadata.
- **Figma**: For prototyping and UI/UX collaboration.

## Challenges and Learnings

Designing an AI recommendation system that felt both intelligent and trustworthy was the biggest challenge. Achieving the right balance between **personalization and diversity** required experimentation with various embedding models and vector search configurations. I also learned how to optimize **API performance** for mobile environments and how to translate raw AI outputs into visually engaging, human-readable recommendations.

## Outcome

Foody successfully delivers accurate, context-aware food suggestions with a simple and elegant user experience. The app’s AI architecture and modular frontend design provide a scalable foundation for future enhancements such as social recommendations and visual dish discovery.

<aside>
We developed a novel recommendation system that leverages AI to deliver hyper-personalised food recommendations. For the techies out there, we used a mixture of **semantic search**, **multi-vector search**, and **RAG architecture** to design this feature.

Our review feature is stripped down to the essentials — your opinions are priceless, and we designed the writing experience to be as frictionless as possible.
