## Overview

The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a real-time application designed to monitor driver alertness and prevent accidents caused by fatigue. The project leverages **deep learning**, **computer vision**, and **transfer learning** to classify driver states as *drowsy* or *alert* based on facial cues.

## Key Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Developed a classification model using **TensorFlow/Keras** with **MobileNetV2** as the base architecture for transfer learning, achieving high accuracy in detecting drowsiness.
- **Data Preprocessing & Augmentation**: Processed the **MRL Eye Dataset (~84,000 images)** with Python for resizing, normalization, augmentation, and undersampling to balance class distributions and improve model generalization.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Implemented **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** for continuous tracking of eye and mouth regions, enabling dynamic monitoring of driver fatigue through live video feeds.
- **Fatigue Scoring System**: Designed a real-time scoring mechanism that aggregates visual indicators (eye closure, yawning frequency) into a continuous fatigue index.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For model training, data preprocessing, and real-time implementation.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: For building and fine-tuning the deep learning model.
- **MobileNetV2**: Lightweight transfer learning model enabling efficient real-time inference.
- **OpenCV**: For live face and eye detection from camera feeds.
- **MediaPipe**: For robust facial landmark detection and tracking.

## Challenges and Learnings

Key challenges included ensuring **real-time performance** while maintaining **model accuracy** and minimizing false positives. Optimizing the inference pipeline and integrating computer vision with deep learning provided valuable insights into balancing accuracy and speed for real-world applications.

## Outcome

The system successfully detects and classifies driver drowsiness in real time with high precision. It demonstrates the potential of combining **AI-based visual recognition** with **lightweight architectures** to build effective safety solutions for automotive and transportation domains.
