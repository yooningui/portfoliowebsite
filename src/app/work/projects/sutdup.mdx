## Overview

SUTDup is an Android application designed to provide a convenient online marketplace for **Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)** students. The app allows users to buy and sell items within the campus community, featuring real-time updates and an optimized user interface for smooth browsing.

## Key Features

- **Online Marketplace**: Developed a full-featured Android shopping platform enabling users to list, browse, and purchase items in real time.
- **Design Patterns**: Implemented **Observer** and **Singleton** design patterns to enhance database communication and ensure efficient resource management.
- **Dynamic UI Updates**: Integrated **RecyclerView** and **FirebaseRecyclerAdapter** to display listings with automatic synchronization, reducing memory usage by **30%** compared to legacy ListView implementations.
- **Firebase Integration**: Utilized **Firebase Realtime Database** for data storage and synchronization, ensuring responsive and up-to-date content delivery.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: For Android application development and implementation of design patterns.
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: For live data updates and backend management.
- **RecyclerView & FirebaseRecyclerAdapter**: For efficient and dynamic rendering of UI components.
- **Android Studio**: As the primary IDE for development and testing.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was maintaining **real-time responsiveness** while minimizing **memory overhead** on mobile devices. Through the use of design patterns and RecyclerView optimization, I improved performance and scalability. This project also strengthened my understanding of **software architecture** and **Android development best practices**.

## Outcome

SUTDup delivered a fast, efficient, and intuitive platform tailored for SUTD students. It streamlined peer-to-peer transactions within the campus community and served as a strong demonstration of applying **object-oriented design principles** to real-world Android applications.
